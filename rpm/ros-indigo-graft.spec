%description
Graft is not yet finished. It's intended to be a full replacement to
robot_pose_ekf, including native absolute references, and arbitrary topic
configuration. If you try to use Graft now, please note that not all parameters
are configured and you will not always see a change in behavior by modifying the
parameters.

# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
