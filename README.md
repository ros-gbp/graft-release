graft
=====

Graft is not yet finished.  It's intended to be a full replacement to robot_pose_ekf, including native absolute references, and arbitrary topic configuration.

If you try to use Graft now, please note that not all parameters are configured and you will not always see a change in behavior by modifying the parameters.

This branch is used for Hydro and Indigo. Indigo status:
